Securely, easily add a watermark to your sensitive photos.
尤其适合因不可抗力而需上传的：（手持）身份证照、隐私证件照、早期小样图片、带版权图片等照片。

Of course, it is also suitable for making emojis. ### Exciting 👓 The watermark repeats all over the picture, and it's a little hard for the bad guys to remove it. 

## Characteristics
### 当时我就念了一首诗 👓

Purely offline local applications , code to see on open source.
Vertical and horizontal spacing can be adjusted, the color of light and dark change at will.
Rotate freely in all sizes and angles, text and pictures can be printed.
水印重复全图铺满，坏蛋除水印有点难

### Seriously (pushes up glasses)
- Security:
The code is completely open source and uses a loose MIT protocol, you are free to Fork yourself to modify and remove code you think is problematic ;)
users with API >= 29 don't even need to request any permissions.
And of course there are no stats, buried points or Device IDs, or even crash reporting (so if you get a crash, please share the crash info with us >_<).
We're forgoing the convenient third-party collection SDK and various stats just so you can use it with confidence.
- Layout: support for horizontal and vertical intervals between the watermark, automatically repeat the full picture.
- Style: font color, transparency, size and rotation angle can be adjusted.
- Content: Support text watermark and image watermark.

## Use
你想怎么用就怎么用。比较适合于需要提交证件照、手持证件照或敏感照片等情况。例如：

Various real names in the country, uploading front and back photos of ID cards at every turn, even handheld ID photos.
Pre-project previews, samples, copyrighted or simply spoofed images
Reference text.

This photo is for xx for xxx purposes only, no other use.

You can turn down the transparency, just don't block the key information.

(For now) we can't (temporarily) prevent information from being uploaded, or even (temporarily) prevent information from being leaked, but we can reduce the value of the information being leaked.

Even if it's (probably) useless in the end, at least you can disgust the leaker a bit.
