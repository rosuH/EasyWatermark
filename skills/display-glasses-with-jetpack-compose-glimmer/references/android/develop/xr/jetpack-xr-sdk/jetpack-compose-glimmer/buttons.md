In Jetpack Compose Glimmer, a [`Button`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/xr/glimmer/Button.composable) is an interactive component that's
optimized for display glasses input, offering clear visual feedback through its
states to guide user actions.

Buttons are built on the Jetpack Compose Glimmer [surface system](https://developer.android.com/develop/xr/jetpack-xr-sdk/jetpack-compose-glimmer/surface), which
automatically handles physical properties like borders and depth.

The standard button contains a text label and optional icons. You can use it for
primary or secondary actions. There are also specialized buttons, such as [icon
buttons](https://developer.android.com/develop/xr/jetpack-xr-sdk/jetpack-compose-glimmer/icon-buttons) and [toggle buttons](https://developer.android.com/develop/xr/jetpack-xr-sdk/jetpack-compose-glimmer/toggle-buttons), which are defined as separate components in
Jetpack Compose Glimmer.

### Default

![](https://developer.android.com/static/images/design/ui/glasses/guides/glasses_components_buttons_anatomy_default.png) An example of some different styles of buttons in Jetpack Compose Glimmer. These examples show default, medium-sized buttons with three button states: Enabled (1), Focused (2), and Pressed (3).

### Large

## Anatomy

A button consists of a container and a label, with optional leading and trailing
icons.

| Part | Description |
|---|---|
| Container | The background surface of the button. |
| Label | The text describing the action. |
| Icon (optional) | Leading or trailing visual indicators. |

## Sizes

Jetpack Compose Glimmer buttons support two size variants. These affect the
minimum height and internal padding.

| Size | Minimum height | Default usage |
|---|---|---|
| Medium | 48.dp | Standard actions and lists (default). |
| Large | 72.dp | High-emphasis actions or primary screen entry points. |

## States

Buttons in Jetpack Compose Glimmer change their appearance to communicate their
state.

- **Enabled**: The default state for an interactive button.
- **Focused** : When focused, the button applies a [`GlimmerTheme.depthEffectLevels.level1`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/xr/glimmer/DepthEffectLevels#level1()) and a focused border highlight.
- **Pressed**: When activated, a semi-transparent white overlay is applied to the surface.
- **Disabled**: The button doesn't respond to input and its visual appearance is adjusted.

## Button defaults

The following defaults apply to standard buttons:

- By default, buttons use [`GlimmerTheme.typography.bodySmall`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/xr/glimmer/Typography#bodySmall()). Make sure that text within buttons is concise and clearly describes the action.
- The default shape for a button is [`GlimmerTheme.shapes.large`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/xr/glimmer/Shapes#large()). This consistent rounding helps users identify buttons across the display glasses interface.

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** Any modifier passed to the `Button` composable is applied to the outer layout. While [`ButtonSize`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/xr/glimmer/ButtonSize) sets the default minimum height, you can also apply custom size modifiers to control the button's final layout, such as [`Modifier.fillMaxWidth`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/foundation/layout/fillMaxWidth.modifier).

## Example: Button with text and icons

A basic button includes only a text label, but you can also add icons to the
start (using `leadingIcon`) or end (using `trailingIcon`) of the text to provide
additional context.

The following code creates a button with both a leading and trailing icon:


```kotlin
Button(
    onClick = { /* Handle navigation or action */ },
    leadingIcon = { Icon(FavoriteIcon, contentDescription = null) },
    trailingIcon = { Icon(SendIcon, contentDescription = null) }
) {
    Text("Text Label", style = GlimmerTheme.typography.titleSmall)
}
```

<br />

## Button groups

The [`ButtonGroup`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/xr/glimmer/ButtonGroup.composable) composable lets you group buttons into a scrollable row
that acts as a focus controller. As the user scrolls, focus automatically moves
to highlight the button corresponding to the current scroll position.
![](https://developer.android.com/static/images/xr/button-group-scroll.gif) An example of a button group scrolling and focusing features.

## Example: Button groups


```kotlin
ButtonGroup(modifier = Modifier.fillMaxWidth()) {
    Button(onClick = {}) { Text("Button 1") }
    Button(onClick = {}) { Text("Button 2") }
    Button(onClick = {}) { Text("Button 3") }
    Button(onClick = {}) { Text("Button 4") }
    Button(onClick = {}) { Text("Button 5") }
}
```

<br />

## Focus control in button groups

You can move the focus to any button in a group to manually control the
selection.

Customize and control scrolling behavior using the `ButtonGroup` state:

1. Declare the state with `rememberButtonGroupState`.
2. Pass it to the `ButtonGroup` composable.
3. Call [`animateScrollToItem`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/xr/glimmer/ButtonGroupState#animateScrollToItem(kotlin.Int,androidx.compose.animation.core.FiniteAnimationSpec)) (or [`scrollToItem`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/xr/glimmer/ButtonGroupState#scrollToItem(kotlin.Int)) for instant scrolling) to scroll to a specific item and automatically move focus to it.

The following code moves the focus from one button to another upon click:


```kotlin
val scope = rememberCoroutineScope()
val state = rememberButtonGroupState()
ButtonGroup(modifier = Modifier.fillMaxWidth(), state = state) {
    Button(onClick = { scope.launch { state.animateScrollToItem(1) } }) {
        Text("Select last item")
    }
    Button(onClick = { scope.launch { state.animateScrollToItem(0) } }) {
        Text("Select first item")
    }
}
```
